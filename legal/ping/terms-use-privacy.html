        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document explains the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (“Terms” and “Policy”) of the mobile application
            <strong>AG Ping</strong> (the “App”). It describes how the App works, what data may be processed, the legal
            bases for processing, your rights as a data subject, and the mutual responsibilities between you (the user)
            and the developer (“I,” “me,” or “Developer”). By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If
            you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>AG Ping is a graphical interface for the <code>ping</code> command, designed to test network connectivity on
            Android devices. It performs local network operations from your device and displays results such as response
            times, packet loss, and basic statistics.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>2. Data Collected and Purpose</h2>
        <p>The App is designed to minimize personal data collection. Below are the categories of data that may be
            processed and their purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-provided data:</strong> IP addresses or hostnames entered to perform connectivity tests
                (purpose: executing the requested service).</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> ping results (latency, packet loss, statistics) and temporary local logs
                for display and troubleshooting (purpose: proper app operation and local diagnostics).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> information required for network requests handled by your device’s OS.
                The App does not automatically transmit this information to external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Voluntary data:</strong> if you contact the developer via email, you may provide your name,
                email, and message content, which are used solely for communication and support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>No automatic collection</strong> of names, email addresses, persistent device identifiers (e.g.,
            Advertising ID), or precise geolocation occurs unless you voluntarily provide them. If third-party services
            (analytics, crash reporting, ads) are ever integrated, this Policy will be updated accordingly.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location and the nature of processing, the applicable legal basis may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance of a contract or service:</strong> processing necessary to provide the requested
                functionality (e.g., processing an IP address to execute a ping test).</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> where applicable, for security, fraud prevention, or app
                improvement, while ensuring your fundamental rights are respected.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> when sensitive or optional data processing occurs, the App will request
                explicit consent.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share user data for commercial purposes. Data may only be
            shared in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to comply with a legal obligation or court order;</li>
            <li>with your explicit authorization;</li>
            <li>with service providers (e.g., hosting or analytics) under strict confidentiality and data protection
                terms, if ever applicable.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. Storage, Retention, and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Ping inputs and results are processed locally on your device and are not transmitted to any external server
            by default. Any data sent voluntarily (e.g., via email) will be retained only as long as necessary to
            respond and comply with legal obligations, unless deletion is requested.</p>
        <p>Should the App ever store data remotely, users will be informed of the storage purpose, retention period, and
            processing location.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>If international data transfer occurs (e.g., due to cloud or analytics integration), the Developer will
            implement adequate safeguards as required by applicable laws (such as standard contractual clauses or
            equivalent protections). Users in regions such as the EU, UK, or California may have additional legal rights
            under their local privacy frameworks.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are applied to protect data against unauthorized access,
            disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no transmission over the Internet or electronic storage
            system is completely secure. If you discover a security issue, please report it immediately to the contact
            address below.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>8. Data Subject Rights</h2>
        <p>In accordance with privacy laws such as Brazil’s LGPD, the EU GDPR, and California’s CCPA/CPRA, users may
            have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confirmation of processing existence;</li>
            <li>Access to their data;</li>
            <li>Correction or rectification;</li>
            <li>Anonymization, blocking, or deletion;</li>
            <li>Data portability (where technically feasible);</li>
            <li>Withdrawal of consent (where processing is based on consent);</li>
            <li>Objection to processing based on legitimate interest;</li>
            <li>Deletion requests (when applicable);</li>
            <li>Filing a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g., ANPD in Brazil, EU data authorities, or state
                agencies in the U.S.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact <a
                href="mailto:adenauer.gabriel@gmail.com">adenauer.gabriel@gmail.com</a>. Provide sufficient details to
            identify your request. A response will be given within the legally required timeframes.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>9. Children and Minors</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed toward children. Users under the minimum legal age in their jurisdiction (e.g., 13
            years in many regions) should not use the App without supervision. No intentional collection of personal
            data from minors occurs. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact me for removal.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>10. Third-Party Services, SDKs, and Advertising</h2>
        <p>Currently, the App does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. Should such services be implemented
            in the future, this Policy will be updated with full details and consent mechanisms where required by law.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>11. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The App is provided “as is” without any express or implied warranties. The Developer shall not be liable for
            indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from misuse, including unauthorized or unethical
            network operations. You are solely responsible for using the App legally and ethically.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the Developer harmless from any claim or damage arising from your
            misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>13. Updates to These Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Policy may be updated periodically to reflect legal, functional, or security changes. Any
            significant modification will be communicated via app updates or the app’s listing page. Continued use of
            the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are primarily governed by the laws of the Federative Republic of Brazil. Users from other
            jurisdictions may enjoy additional rights under their local laws (e.g., GDPR in the EU, CCPA/CPRA in
            California). For disputes arising in Brazil, the competent court is Joinville, SC, unless otherwise required
            by law.</p>
